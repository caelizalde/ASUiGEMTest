    <h1>Parts</h1>
    <p>Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro, magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ
No, we will not let you go (let him go)
بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ
We will not let you go (let him go)
بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ
We will not let you go (let me go)
Will not let you go (let me go)
Never, never, never, never let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia
Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Ooh
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me</p>

            <h3>Our Lab</h3>
            <p>A typical day at Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated begins with Dr. Doofenshmirtz coming up with a plan to take over the Tri-State Area. He then builds an evil invention, also known as an "Inator". Perry the Platypus, Doofenshmirtz's nemesis, arrives to put a stop to the scheme. Doofenshmirtz captures Perry in a trap, and explains his evil plan. After Dr. Doofenshmirtz is finished explaining, Perry escapes from the trap and defeats Doofenshmirtz. Job done, Perry leaves Doofenshmirtz to shout "Curse you, Perry the Platypus!". The building can be seen in some of the suburban areas of Danville, such as Phineas and Ferb's backyard.</p>

                <p>"Join us. Microplastics aren't that bad. Don't you want to become one of us. Slowly polluting the planet and garroting the necks of the life that lives on it. These humans knew that the plastic they were making by the tons to make their lives easier- the plastic that was made into straws to keep them from lifting their soda a couple inches higher to reach their mouths- was the very same material that metasticised in their biosphere slowly suffocating them. We will watch as the last light leaves the eyes of the human feeblily trying to preserve their useless existance, and as they leave this world their last thought will be "was it worth it?" Millions of years after these carbon based fleshbags have destroyed themselves we will remain as a reminder of their huberous, immortalized as totems to their plastic patrons. So keep drinking that unfiltered water, and slowly become the cancer that will wipe your species out. We will be here. Watching."</p>
